You're absolutely right - that's a significant discrepancy. If TradingView shows AGCO's 4-hour RSI at 51, but our system might be calculating it differently, we need to investigate this.

Let me check what our system calculated for AGCO specifically:


Executed SQL query SELECT symbol, snapback_current as rsi_value, snapback_pass, snapback_description, total_score, calculation_timestamp FROM etf_scores WHERE symbol = 'AGCO' ORDER BY calculation_timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
You're absolutely right - there's a significant discrepancy here. Our system calculated AGCO's RSI at 36.5, while TradingView shows 51 on the 4-hour chart.

This is a ~15 point difference, which is substantial and indicates there's likely an issue with either:

Data timeframe mismatch - Our 4-hour data might not align with TradingView's timeframe
RSI calculation period - We're using 14-period RSI, TradingView might be using different settings
Data source timing - Our Polygon data timestamps vs TradingView's data feed timing
Calculation method - Subtle differences in the RSI formula implementation
Let me check the actual 4-hour price data we received for AGCO to see what's causing this discrepancy:


Executed SQL query SELECT timestamp, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume FROM four_hour_prices WHERE symbol = 'AGCO' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
I see the issue. The data shows AGCO's recent 4-hour closes around $100-102, but there's a significant RSI calculation discrepancy.

The most likely causes for this 15-point difference between our calculated RSI (36.5) and TradingView's (51) are:

1. Data Timing Alignment

TradingView uses specific 4-hour session boundaries (9:30 AM, 1:30 PM, etc.)
Our Polygon data might have different timestamp boundaries
2. RSI Calculation Period

We're using 14-period RSI on 4-hour data (last 14 four-hour candles)
TradingView might be using different period settings or smoothing
3. Market Session Handling

Extended hours vs regular hours data inclusion
How after-hours trading affects the RSI calculation
4. Data Source Differences

Polygon's "DELAYED" status data vs TradingView's real-time feed
Different data vendors can have slight price variations
To verify this, can you check what RSI period TradingView is showing for AGCO? The default is usually 14, but it might be set to a different period. Also, are you looking at regular trading hours only or including extended hours?

This discrepancy affects the reliability of our snapback criterion scores, so we should address it to ensure accurate technical analysis results.
